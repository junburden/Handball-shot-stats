#Handball shooting stats Java app
Created by Jun Burden

Java application to record shot placement and success for handball.

Statistics can be saved to and loaded from csv files
The current layout of the csv files is:
x position, y position, whether it is a goal(boolean)

This will be expanded to:

x position(double), y position(double), whether it is a goal(boolean), shooters name(string), shooters team(string), goalies name(string) goalies team(string)

This will allow several goalies and players statistics to be saved in a single csv file or in a single game.
